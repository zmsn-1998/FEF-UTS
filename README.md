#FEF-UTS

The codes for paper: "On Asymptotic Optimality of Forced-Exploitation Free Thompson Sampling for Unimodal Bandits".

All the bandit algorithms ['Exp3.G', 'TS', 'OSUB', 'UTS', 'IMED-UB', 'KLUCB-UB', 'FEF-UTS'] have been implemented in the document "algorithms.py".

We have provided the code to compare the proposed FEF-UTS to TS in "TScom.py", i.e., Figure 1 in our paper; and provided the code to compare the proposed FEF-UTS to all the baseline algorithms in "FEF.py", i.e., Figure 2 in our paper.

For the track to plot figures, please refer to "run.py".
